Ok my reader, I tried to do githubpages, but I struggled for too long and gave up..... 
To run the file, follow these instructions:
Go to the project folder (tailwindCssProject) and call npm install, then it's simple: run index.html which is in the dist folder
Thank you for your attention and understanding.
